## Hotel Booking Prediction

### Business Problem
This case study investigates a dataset that includes details on hotel reservations and related attributes. In this study, we will examine the features that are available to hotel owners and how they may use them to estimate the outcome of a booking. If hotel owners used the knowledge gained from this research, they might be able to better organize their businesses and comprehend how they can make money in these challenging times. Based on the characteristics of each hotel reservation, my algorithm will determine whether or not a booking will be canceled. Based on the remaining features in the dataset, my goal is to identify the optimal model to use tree-based algorithms to forecast cancellations of hotel reservations.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Business Problem
My objective for this project is to assist in preventing, reducing, or avoiding credit card fraud. fraud is typically only discovered after it has already occurred, it is crucial for me to evaluate and visualize the Credit Card Transactions datasets. However, fraud detection is the best option for eliminating it from the environment and averting a recurrence in the event that they are unable to prevent it in time

### Approach
EDA- In this part I am going to see the distribution of feature variables and derive the correlation matrix.
Model development-   In this portion I will be decision tree model to determine the accuracy of test and train data. After this I might use K-means or PCA to predict the credit card fraud

## Telecom Customer Churn

### Business Problem
As 24% of its customers left in the most recent quarter, a telecommunications business (Telco Co.) that sells residential Voice and Internet services has a serious churn problem. TelCo has a contract with me that complies with the following business requirements because it wants to use a predictive model to implement client retention strategies:

Identify the most accurate prediction model for customer churn risk.
Describe how each predictor's relative impact on the model's predictions is affected.

## Housing Price Prediction

### Business Problem
Real estate investors can use this model to study and analyze real estate characteristics and how they affect market value in order to seize opportunities to buy, sell, and renovate in the incredibly lucrative and lucrative market. The business will gain a thorough understanding of the market with the use of a machine learning algorithm on historical data. It may respond to a variety of queries, including:
What might a brand-new home cost?
Where is it most advantageous to buy a new property?
Is a home's renovation necessary?
Which criteria determine if a real estate investor wants to improve a home they recently 
purchased?

##  Sentiment Analysis of covid

### Business Problem
The government provides free vaccinations to its residents, but many people are reluctant to get them. People everywhere, whether in developed and underdeveloped nations, have this kind of risk perception. Analysis of public opinion toward vaccination is the goal of this study. How are people reacting to the many vaccinations made by various nations—positively, adversely, or neutrally? determining the distribution of each opinion on vaccinations Which model analyzes social media data more effectively?

## Salary Prediction

### Business Problem
An employee's compensation is arguably one of the most crucial elements in hiring and job retention. Companies that compete in the same industry should always establish a benchmark for how much they should pay for available positions within their own organizations. In turn, this enables them to keep their workers and compete for talent in both their own industries and in those of other industries. The goal of this project is to analyze a set of job ads and their associated salaries in order to forecast salaries for a subsequent set of job postings. This might be helpful in arbitrating salaries using machine learning algorithms that would forecast those values, as one example salary prediction project.

## Heart Patient Survival prediction

### Business Problem
The hospital has been examining historical data on patient survival in an effort to enhance the results for heart patients. They were unable to pinpoint the elements contributing to successful patient outcomes.

Create a model to predict whether patients will survive for at least a year after receiving initial treatment, which will indicate the patients' prognosis.

## Mental Health budget

### Business Problem
The difficulty we have is related to employee access to programs that may help them manage and ultimately treat their mental health conditions, as well as the expenses connected with those services. I sum up the issue as follows: "Is it feasible to anticipate with accuracy which employees in the workplace have a mental illness, in order that they may be provided with the support and services they require as part of corporate initiatives?"
To properly frame the analysis, let's be more precise and narrow the problem's scope. A corporation may provide an employee with a mental health examination that includes the services of a therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist in addition to other treatments if it is certain that the person has a mental health condition. 
Therefore, my goal is to develop a machine learning model that can correctly predict whether a person has a mental health condition. If so, a business may allocate funds at the beginning of the year for professional therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist-led mental health examinations.

## Market Channel Investment Spent

### Business Problem
A fictitious leadership group has discovered a significant chance to grow its market share inside a certain industry category. The team also thinks that raising brand awareness would be the right market lever to drive market share.

The executive team thinks that the McKinsey Consumer Decision Journey and the path to buy of their target segment are compatible. By raising the number of target consumers who are considering their product, or by increasing the number of customers in the initial consideration group, they have discovered tremendous possibilities for boosting sales within this framework. They want to ensure that their marketing budget is being utilized across all of their marketing channels as effectively as possible.

## HR Analytic – Employee Retention

###  Business Problem
One of the most prevalent problems in any organization is attrition. The time, money, and effort required to train new hires can result in significant losses for the business. Onboarding, advertising, hiring, training, and lost productivity are all included in the loss cost. Attrition also breeds mistrust or uncertainty among current workers toward management. This project intends to construct a predictive model, offer retention advice, and give in-depth study of the factors that affect employee turnover.
